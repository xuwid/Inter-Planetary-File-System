In this project, we were required to implement a special type of Distributed Hash Table (DHT) called Ring DHT using C++ in Visual Studio 2022.
The Ring DHT uses a 160-bit circular identifier space and is responsible for storing and retrieving data (IPFS files) across multiple machines geo-distributed across the internet.
Our implementation has allowed for the configuration of the identifier space size, support the addition and removal of machines without disrupting the functionality of the Ring DHT,
and provide options to insert and remove files, print the routing table of any machine, and display the complete path taken by requests. Additionally, we have submitted
a well-documented code and a document highlighting the design in terms of relationships/associations between different classes of your program.
